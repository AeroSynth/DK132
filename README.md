Python 3 code to display serial data from FRDM-KL05z
This program is a simple real-time data aquisition program that reads data from a NXP Freedom FRDM-KL05z board and displays it using tkinter.  It is very simple and only requires the serial module.  
A version using classes and matplotlib will be available soon
